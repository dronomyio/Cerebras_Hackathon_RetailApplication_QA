# Retail Q&A Application

This application provides a question-answering system for retail products using the Cerebras API. It allows users to ask questions about products and receive AI-generated answers.

## Retail Q&A Application: Overview and Future Improvements
### Overview
The Retail Q&A Application is a modern, AI-powered solution designed to provide instant answers to customer questions about retail products. Built with a clean, modular architecture, it leverages the powerful Cerebras Qwen-3-32B model to generate accurate, contextual responses based on product information stored in a simple JSON database.
### The application consists of two main components:
A Flask-based API backend that processes questions and generates answers
A responsive frontend interface that allows users to browse products and ask questions
### Key features include:
AI-powered question answering using the Cerebras API
Fallback answer generation when the API is unavailable
Simple product data management through JSON
Dockerized deployment for easy setup and scaling
Clean separation of concerns between frontend and backend
### Future Improvements
#### 1. Enhanced Data Management
Database Integration: Replace the JSON file with a proper database (MongoDB, PostgreSQL) for better scalability and performance
Admin Interface: Add an admin panel for managing products without editing JSON files
Data Versioning: Implement versioning for product data to track changes over time
#### 2. Advanced AI Capabilities
Fine-tuning: Fine-tune the Cerebras model on domain-specific retail data for more accurate answers
Multi-modal Support: Add image understanding capabilities to answer questions about product visuals
Conversation History: Implement session management to maintain context across multiple questions
Sentiment Analysis: Analyze customer questions to detect sentiment and adjust responses accordingly
#### 3. User Experience Enhancements
User Accounts: Add user registration and authentication for personalized experiences
Question History: Save user questions and answers for future reference
Product Recommendations: Suggest related products based on user questions and browsing behavior
Mobile App: Develop native mobile applications for iOS and Android
#### 4. Performance Optimization
Caching Layer: Implement Redis caching for frequently asked questions
Load Balancing: Add load balancing for handling high traffic volumes
Content Delivery Network: Use a CDN for static assets to improve global performance
Asynchronous Processing: Implement async processing for long-running operations
#### 5. Analytics and Monitoring
Usage Analytics: Track question patterns and user behavior to improve the system
Performance Monitoring: Add comprehensive monitoring and alerting
A/B Testing: Implement A/B testing for different answer generation strategies
Feedback Loop: Add a mechanism for users to rate answer quality
#### 6. Integration Capabilities
API Documentation: Create comprehensive API documentation with Swagger/OpenAPI
Webhooks: Implement webhooks for integration with external systems
Multi-channel Support: Extend the Q&A capability to chat platforms, voice assistants, etc.
E-commerce Integration: Connect with e-commerce platforms for real-time product data
#### 7. Security Enhancements
Rate Limiting: Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
Input Validation: Add more robust input validation and sanitization
API Authentication: Add API keys or OAuth for secure API access
Data Encryption: Implement end-to-end encryption for sensitive data
By implementing these improvements, the Retail Q&A Application can evolve from a basic question-answering system into a comprehensive customer engagement platform that significantly enhances the retail experience while reducing support costs.

```

## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- OpenRouter API key (optional, for Cerebras API access)

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd retail-qa-app
   ```

2. Make the setup script executable:
   ```
   chmod +x setup.sh
   ```

3. Run the setup script:
   ```
   ./setup.sh YOUR_OPENROUTER_API_KEY
   ```
   Note: If you don't provide an API key, the application will use fallback answers.

4. Access the application:
   - Frontend: http://localhost:3000
   - API health check: http://localhost:5000/api/health

## Testing

To verify that the application is working correctly:

1. Make the test script executable:
   ```
   chmod +x test.sh
   ```

2. Run the test script:
   ```
   ./test.sh
   ```

This will test all API endpoints and functionality.

## API Endpoints

- `GET /api/health`: Health check endpoint
- `GET /api/products`: Get all products
- `GET /api/products/<product_id>`: Get a specific product
- `POST /api/ask`: Ask a question about products
  - Request body: `{"question": "What is the ModalAI VOXL 2?"}`
  - Optional: `{"question": "...", "productId": "voxl-2"}`

## Adding New Products

To add new products, edit the `data/products.json` file. Each product should have the following structure:

```json
{
  "productId": "unique-id",
  "name": "Product Name",
  "description": "Detailed description of the product",
  "category": "Product Category",
  "price": 999.99,
  "specifications": [
    "Specification 1",
    "Specification 2"
  ],
  "features": [
    "Feature 1",
    "Feature 2"
  ],
  "faqs": [
    "Q: Question? A: Answer.",
    "Q: Another question? A: Another answer."
  ]
}
```

## Stopping the Application

To stop the application:

```
docker-compose down
```

## Troubleshooting

- If the frontend cannot connect to the API, ensure that the API service is running and accessible at http://localhost:5000
- Check the Docker logs for any errors: `docker-compose logs`
- Verify that the OpenRouter API key is correctly set if you're using the Cerebras API
